# Impact of Return policy change on Sales in a Retail Store. 

## Inspiration
* During my academic studies in MS, I made several projects related to data analytics and data science. I have explored and understand different fields related to data science such as Machine Learning, Big Data, Data visualization,Marketing Analytics, etc. But I also wanted to understand "Econometrics" aspect, of data science as well. Though, I was not able to take the formal course on Econonetrics, with the help of one of my Professor's, I understood its nuances, and made a project with his guidance, using a dataset provided by him. As the dataset is very large, I was not able to pull it in git.

## Summary
* This project uses the jwelery retail store dataset. 
* Large jewelry retail company with several brands and
categories
* Thousands of stores, (both physical and online) with millions of
transaction data
* Data collected from April 1st, 2013 to Mar 31st, 2014
* Primary and secondary brands changed their return policy from
90 to 45 days on Oct 1st,2013
* Sister brand did NOT change its return policy which remained
at 60 days
